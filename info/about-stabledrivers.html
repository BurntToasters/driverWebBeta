              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Driver ranking:</h3>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Driver rankings are based off of my personal experience with using the "Considered a stable driver" Nvidia drivers.</p>
              <h4>Example:</h4>
              <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: forestgreen;">A- <b>-</b> A+ | Best overall experience with drivers</li>
              <br>
              <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: darkgreen;">B <b>-</b> B+ | Very good overall experience. Some bugs here and there but solid choice.</li>
              <br>
              <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: darkolivegreen;">C+ <b>-</b> B- | Ok experience. Too many stutters and bugs to rate higher. Would reccomend a higher rated driver, unless this specific driver is needed for game/software compatibility.</li>
              <br>
              <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: darkslategray;">C and below | Not good experience. High GPU latency, high amount of stutters and bugs. Personally do not reccomend installing.</li>
              <br>
              <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #383838;"><b>/</b> Means the driver is pending a grade. Check back later!</li>
              <br>
              
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="color: cadetblue">&#9432</b> For reference, my current setup is: Ryzen 9 7900X, RTX 4080 SUPER, 64GB DDR5 6000MHz, Win 11 23H2</p>

              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What does "Considered a stable driver" mean?</h3>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">The stable driver tag I have on some of the driver download pages refers to community feedback and response to newley release drivers. I usually look at reddit threads regarding a new driver release, and if the general outlook is that the driver seems to be working well and is worth an update, I put that specific text next to the driver version with a link to the thread I used to determine adding that tag. Additionally I also take into consideration my personal experience with using said drivers.</p>
